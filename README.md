# üå∏ FlowerShopMS

A **distributed e-commerce application** for a fictional flower shop, built as part of the **Microservices course (Winter 2025)** at Champlain College.

This project demonstrates **modern microservices architecture** with real-world deployment practices, integrating multiple services, databases, and tools.
